## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/committee-management.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install the necessary dependencies using Composer (if PhpSpreadsheet is not installed manually):
    ```bash

    ```

4. Ensure that your web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) is properly set up to execute PHP scripts.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser or deploy it on your web server.
2. Fill out the form with the required details (name, year, contact) and submit it.
3. The submitted data will be stored in an `Excel` file named `data.xlsx` in the project root directory.

### Example

Hereâ€™s how the form works:

- **Name**: Enter your full name.
- **Year**: Specify your year (e.g., `2024`).
- **Contact**: Provide your contact information (e.g., `email@example.com`).

Upon submission, the data is automatically saved to the Excel file.
